# Tempesta-RedSTED
The Tempesta (github.com/TestaLab/Tempesta) version used for the RedSTED, in the TestaLab @SciLifeLab.

This version of Tempesta is used to control the STED microscope built in the Testa Lab (www.testalab.org) at SciLifeLab in Stockholm, Sweden. It was adapted from the Tempesta used to control the MoNaLISA microscope developed in the lab, which in turn was adapted from the Tormenta custom-written microscope-control software (github.com/fedebarabas/tormenta).
